# DirectX Shader Compiler

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/oaf66n7w30xbrg38/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/antiagainst/directxshadercompiler/branch/master)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler)

The DirectX Shader Compiler project includes a compiler and related tools used to compile High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) programs into DirectX Intermediate Language (DXIL) representation. Applications that make use of DirectX for graphics, games, and computation can use it to generate shader programs.

For more information, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki).

## Features and Goals

The starting point of the project is a fork of the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) projects, modified to accept HLSL and emit a validated container that can be consumed by GPU drivers.

At the moment, the DirectX HLSL Compiler provides the following components:

- dxc.exe, a command-line tool that can compile HLSL programs for shader model 6.0 or higher

- dxcompiler.dll, a DLL providing a componentized compiler, assembler, disassembler, and validator

- various other tools based on the above components

The Microsoft Windows SDK releases include a supported version of the compiler and validator.

The goal of the project is to allow the broader community of shader developers to contribute to the language and representation of shader programs, maintaining the principles of compatibility and supportability for the platform. It's currently in active development across two axes: language evolution (with no impact to DXIL representation), and surfacing hardware capabilities (with impact to DXIL, and thus requiring coordination with GPU implementations).

### SPIR-V CodeGen

As an example of community contribution, this project can also target the [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/) intermediate representation. Please see the [doc](docs/SPIR-V.rst) for how HLSL features are mapped to SPIR-V, and the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/SPIR%E2%80%90V-CodeGen) page for how to build, use, and contribute to the SPIR-V CodeGen.

## Building Sources

Note: Instead of building manually, you can download the artifacts built by Appveyor for the latest master branch at [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/antiagainst/directxshadercompiler/branch/master/artifacts).

Note: If you intend to build from sources on Linux/macOS, follow [these instructions](docs/DxcOnUnix.rst).

Before you build, you will need to have some additional software installed. This is the most straightforward path - see [Building Sources](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Building-Sources) on the Wiki for more options, including Visual Studio 2015 and Ninja support.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads).
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads). Select the following workloads: Universal Windows Platform Development and Desktop Development with C++.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Version 2.7.x is required, 3.x might work but it's not officially supported. You need not change your PATH variable during installation.

After cloning the project, you can set up a build environment shortcut by double-clicking the `utils\hct\hctshortcut.js` file. This will create a shortcut on your desktop with a default configuration.

Tests are built using the TAEF framework. Unless you have the Windows Driver Kit installed, you should run the script at `utils\hct\hctgettaef.py` from your build environment before you start building to download and unzip it as an external dependency. You should only need to do this once.

To build, run this command on the HLSL Console.

    hctbuild

You can also clean, build and run tests with this command.

    hctcheckin


To see a list of additional commands available, run `hcthelp`

## Running Tests

To run tests, open the HLSL Console and run this command after a successful build.

    hcttest

Some tests will run shaders and verify their behavior. These tests also involve a driver that can run these execute these shaders. See the next section on how this should be currently set up.

## Running Shaders

To run shaders compiled as DXIL, you will need support from the operating system as well as from the driver for your graphics adapter. Windows 10 Creators Update is the first version to support DXIL shaders. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Running-Shaders) for information on using experimental support or the software adapter.

### Hardware Support

Hardware GPU support for DXIL is provided by the following vendors:

#### NVIDIA
NVIDIA's r396 drivers (r397.64 and later) provide release mode support for DXIL
1.1 and Shader Model 6.1 on Win10 1709 and later, and experimental mode support
for DXIL 1.2 and Shader Model 6.2 on Win10 1803 and later. These drivers also
support DXR in experimental mode.

Drivers can be downloaded from [geforce.com](https://www.geforce.com/drivers).

#### AMD
AMDâ€™s driver (Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition 18.4.1 or later) provides release mode support for DXIL 1.1 and Shader Model 6.1. Drivers can be downloaded from [AMD's download site](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download).

### Intel
Intel's 15.60 drivers (15.60.0.4849 and later) support release mode for DXIL 1.0 and Shader Model 6.0 as well as
release mode for DXIL 1.1 and Shader Model 6.1 (View Instancing support only).

Drivers can be downloaded from the following link [Intel Graphics Drivers](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers)

Direct access to 15.60 driver (latest as of of this update) is provided below:

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
